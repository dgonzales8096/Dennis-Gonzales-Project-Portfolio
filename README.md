##[Exploratory Data Analysis: Yelp Dataset Project Overview](https://github.com/dgonzales8096/Dennis_Gonzales_Project_Portfolio/blob/main/Yelp%20EDA%20Project.ipynb)

- Explore Yelp business dataset and manipulate data with NumPy and Pandas
- Identify and explore features 
- Add features as needed
- Identify outliers
- Map out businesses to better understand business location and Yelp reviews
- As outlined in the Yelp Dataset User [agreement](https://github.com/dgonzales8096/Dennis_Gonzales_Project_Portfolio/blob/main/Yelp_Dataset_User_Agreement.pdf), this Yelp dataset is used strictly for non-commercial use.
- The output map can be found [here](https://dgonzales8096.github.io/Dennis_Gonzales_Project_html_files/Yelp_biz_map.html)
